Continuing from BJA-4... Here are the main differences:

Complex class:

Adds new constructors for double and String inputs.
Implements more sophisticated parsing for String input of complex numbers.
The toString() method handles zero real parts differently.


Rational class:

Adds a new constructor for double inputs.
Implements more robust parsing for String inputs, including mixed fractions.
The toString() method handles negative mixed fractions differently.
Includes a check for division by zero.


Utility class:

Adds new methods for converting doubles to rationals.
The findGCD method now handles negative inputs.


Functionality:

This version can handle more complex inputs, including mixed fractions and complex numbers in string form.
It provides methods to convert between different number representations more flexibly.


This version is more comprehensive and capable of handling a wider range of inputs and conversions between different number representations. It also includes more robust error handling and edge case management.
